# Classification and Prediction of Breast Cancer using Linear Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest

This project aims to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using various machine learning algorithms. It compares the performance of multiple models on a labeled dataset containing key tumor features. Used Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) data set.



**Project Structure**
-
**breastcancer.ipynb:** Main Jupyter Notebook that handles data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

**databreast.csv:** The dataset used for training and testing the models.

**index.pdf:** This project is based on the methodology and requirements outlined in this IEEE paper

**Technologies Used**
-
**Python**

**Jupyter Notebook**

**Scikit-learn**

**Pandas**

**Matplotlib**

**ðŸ“Š Models Used & Performance**
-
**The following machine learning models were trained and evaluated:**

- **Linear Regression (used as a baseline classifier)**

- **Decision Tree Classifier**

- **Random Forest Classifier**

**Each model's performance was evaluated using:**

- **Accuracy**

- **Precision**

- **Recall**
